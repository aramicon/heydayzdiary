# heydayzdiary

HEYDAYZDIARY is a lightweight diary/journal service built with Django.

It allows all kinds of useful information to be captured, such as work hours, income and expenditure, exercise, and study, all based on DAYS

DAY information can be added quickly, and the main page/screen shows the days as a surface of blocks. 

As information builds up, useful statistics can be generated. E.G. how many hours did you work this week? How many hours did you sleep? Did you exercise more or less than last week?
